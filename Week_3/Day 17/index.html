<h1> RESTAURANT</h1>
<p>At (RN), we’re serving up more than (TF). In fact, (RN) Famous (recipe) is one of our unexpected specialties. Reminiscent of butcher shops back in the day, each slow-smoked, sizzling prime chop measures seven-fingers high. Our signature recipe, that we have perfected for more than four decades, is rubbed with a secret blend of seasonings, cured and roasted on a rotisserie with pecan wood for up to six hours before it’s topped with (RN) signature herb-garlic butter, then carved tableside.
(RN) specializes in delicious food featuring fresh ingredients  We went with choices that were popular catering requests — basic, down-home style — just from a wide range of regions. We are known for our generous portions of BBQ, Southern, Cajun/Creole meals, plus a touch of Caribbean fun. We will tell you now – save room for dessert! </p>
