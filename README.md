# 100 Days of Coding Challenge - Rajendran 

Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding Challenge repository! Here, I'll be documenting my coding journey over the next 100 days as I work on various coding projects and exercises to improve my skills. The goal of this challenge is to stay consistent in my coding practice and make meaningful progress. Most of time, I'll be coding in Java for problem solving.

## Challenge Rules
- **Code Every Day:** I commit to learning and writing code every day for the next 100 days.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms:** My first objective of this challenge is to learn problem solving skills. So, I'll be focusing in solving leetcode problems by learning different data structures and effecient algorithms.
- **Development:** The second objective is to indulge myself in the world of development and start building my development journey with tiny projects. I will be learning quite a few tech stacks related to development over this challenge.
- **Object Oriented Programming:** The third objective is to learn OOP's concepts such as Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheeritance and Polymorphism using java 
- **Track Progress:** I'll use this repository to log my daily coding activities, sharing my code, thoughts, and progress.

## Day-by-Day Progress
I will maintain a daily log of my activities, coding projects, and what I've learned. 

## Project Showcase
I'll showcase some of the projects I'm working on throughout this challenge. 
Feel free to reach out, collaborate, or follow my progress. You can connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Rajendran2201) or on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajendran-s-02b222270/).

Let's embark on this coding adventure together! ðŸš€
